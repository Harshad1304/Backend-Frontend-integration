## Handling Cross-Origin Errors

1. **Whitelist the URL in the Backend:**
   - If you're facing cross-origin (CORS) errors, you need to whitelist the frontend URL in your backend server. This allows the frontend to communicate with the backend without issues.

2. **Use a Proxy in the Frontend:**
   - Alternatively, you can set up a proxy in the frontend. This forwards requests from your frontend to the backend, bypassing CORS issues. The method to do this varies depending on your setup (e.g., Vite, Create React App, etc.).

## Serving Static Files

1. **Serving Static Files with Express:**
   - You can serve your frontend build files from your backend using a command like `app.use(express.static('dist'))`. This tells your backend to serve the files located in the `dist` folder as static assets.

2. **Why This Isn’t Ideal:**
   - Moving your frontend build files into the backend project isn't recommended because:
     - **Maintenance Hassle:** Every time you make changes to the frontend, you'll have to rebuild the project and replace the `dist` folder in the backend.
     - **Separation of Concerns:** It’s better to keep your frontend and backend projects separate. This ensures cleaner, more manageable codebases.
